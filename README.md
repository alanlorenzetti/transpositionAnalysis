# Scripts employed on MinION DNA-Seq analysis

This repo was created to store scripts used to process MinION DNA-Seq data and detect transpositions in _Halobacterium salinarum_ NRC-1. The results were presented at NCM 2018, and made available [here](https://www.ime.usp.br/~alorenze/ncm2018/refs/).  

I did not mean to write a pipeline or tool, this is just a collection of scripts that should be executed in a specific order with no guarantee of success without several adaptations.
